Plugins
-------

Plugins are [rosjava](http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava) applications that may be
dinamically loaded, to be used they must be converted into dex's and placed on
**/sdcard/ros**, you may convert a `.jar` into a `.dex` like this

    $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/<version>/dx --dex --output=plugin.dex plugin.jar

Regarding the version, any *should* work.
